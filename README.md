# TechDegree-Project-6
Static Node.js and Express site

This is a Portfolio site to display all the projects I've built.  The site contains a landing page, an about page, contact information, and several project pages.

The projects are stored in a JSON file and accessed with JavaScript to populate the template HTML documents.

HTML templates are created with Express and rendered with PUG.

Displays all projects completed in a server hosted by GitHub.

The font, box shadows, and background colors have been modified from their originals.

Server can be started with "npm start" in the Terminal/Console.
